# rustyTrade
Hi, this is my simple trading system with orders and api written in Rust. A project to learn Rust with pratices.

## Structure Overview
1. main.rs: The entry point of the application.
2. stock.rs: Defines the Stock struct and related methods.
3. api.rs: Handles API calls for fetching real-time stock data.
4. strategy.rs: Implements the trading strategy logic.
5. config.rs: Manages configuration settings and command-line arguments.
6. util.rs: Contains utility functions and common helpers.

## Compilation and Dependencies
- Place each of these code snippets into their respective files in a Rust project.
- Add necessary dependencies like reqwest, tokio, serde, etc., in Cargo.toml.
- Ensure that the modules are correctly referenced and public functions are exposed as needed.
Compile and run the project with cargo run.
